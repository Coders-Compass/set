## What this project does

This package provides a generic interface and an in-memory implementation of finite sets in Go. It serves both as a practical utility and as a teaching tool for understanding set theory concepts through code.

Key features:
- Generic implementation supporting any comparable type.
- O(1) operations using hash-based storage.
- Complete set theory operations. (union, intersection, difference, etc.)
- Advanced operations like Cartesian product and power set.
- Comprehensive test coverage with examples from set theory.
- Clear documentation connecting mathematical concepts to implementation.

## Why it's useful

Our set implementation helps you:
- Manage collections of unique elements efficiently
- Perform set operations with guaranteed performance characteristics
- Learn set theory through practical code examples
- See how mathematical concepts translate to Go code

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
go get -u coderscompass.org/set
```

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"coderscompass.org/set"
)

func main() {
	// Create sets
	hobbits := set.NewHashSet[string]()
	fellowship := set.NewHashSet[string]()

	// Add elements
	hobbits.Insert("Frodo")
	hobbits.Insert("Sam")
	fellowship.Insert("Frodo")
	fellowship.Insert("Gandalf")

	// Find intersection
	hobbitFellows := hobbits.Intersection(fellowship)

	// Result contains {"Frodo"}
	expected := set.NewHashSet[string]()
	expected.Insert("Frodo")

	if !hobbitFellows.Equals(expected) {
		fmt.Println("Expected hobbitFellows to be equal to expected")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("hobbitFellows is equal to expected")
	}

	// Advanced operations
	product := set.CartesianProduct(hobbits, fellowship)
	powerSet := set.PowerSet(hobbits)

	// Print results using implicit string conversion
	fmt.Println(product)
	fmt.Println(powerSet)
}
```

### Performance Guarantees

| Operation          | Time Complexity  |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Insert/Remove      | O(1)             |
| Contains           | O(1)             |
| Intersection       | O(min(n, m))     |
| Union              | O(n + m)         |
| Difference         | O(m)             |
| Cartesian Product  | O(n Ã— m)         |
| Power Set          | O(2^n)           |

Here `n` and `m` are the sizes of the two sets involved in the operations.
